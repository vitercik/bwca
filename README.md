# Beyond Worst-Case Analysis

## Course information

- **Quarter:** Spring 2025
- **Lecture time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:30-2:50pm
- **Lecture location:** 260-113
- **Prerequisites:**  Introductory algorithms class (e.g., CS 161). CS261 is recommended but not required.

## Description

This course is motivated by algorithm design problems where traditional worst-case analysis fails to meaningfully distinguish between different solutions, or recommends an intuitively "wrong" solution over the "right" one. We systematically explore alternative frameworks to traditional worst-case analysis that provide rigorous and robust performance guarantees while overcoming these limitations. Topics include: instance optimality; smoothed analysis; parameterized analysis and condition numbers; models of data (pseudorandomness, locality, diffuse adversaries, etc.); average-case analysis; robust distributional analysis; resource augmentation; planted and semi-random graph models. Motivating problems will be drawn from online algorithms, online learning, constraint satisfaction problems, graph partitioning, scheduling, linear programming, hashing, machine learning, and auction theory.

## Course structure

This course will be facilitated through in-person class meetings with the professor. All assignments will be posted on Canvas. Announcements will also be made through Canvas, and any questions should be posted to Ed.
- **Lecture:** Our class will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30-2:50 PM in 260-113.
- **Homework:** Students will submit four homework assignments on Gradescope (linked to on Canvas). The deadline for each homework will be Thursdays at 11:59pm.
- **[Project](project.md):** Students will complete a course project, in a group or individually.

## Grading

Grading will be out of 100 points as follows:
- **Homeworks:** 60 points (15 for each of four homeworks)
- **[Project](https://vitercik.github.io/bwca/project/#grading):** 40 points
