# Beyond Worst-Case Analysis

## Course information

- **Quarter:** Spring 2025
- **Lecture time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:30-2:50pm
- **Lecture location:** 260-113
- **Prerequisites:**  CS 161 (required). CS261 is recommended but not required.

## Description

This course is motivated by problems for which the traditional worst-case analysis of algorithms fails to differentiate meaningfully between different solutions, or recommends an intuitively "wrong" solution over the "right" one. This course studies systematically alternatives to traditional worst-case analysis that nevertheless enable rigorous and robust guarantees on the performance of an algorithm. Topics include: instance optimality; smoothed analysis; parameterized analysis and condition numbers; models of data (pseudorandomness, locality, diffuse adversaries, etc.); average-case analysis; robust distributional analysis; resource augmentation; planted and semi-random graph models. Motivating problems will be drawn from online algorithms, online learning, constraint satisfaction problems, graph partitioning, scheduling, linear programming, hashing, machine learning, and auction theory.

## Course structure

This course will be facilitated through in-person class meetings with the professor. All assignments will be posted on Canvas. Announcements will also be made through Canvas, and any questions should be posted to Ed.
- **Lecture:** Our class will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30-2:50 PM in 260-113.
- **Homework:** You will submit your bi-weekly homework assignments on Gradescope (linked to on Canvas). The deadline for each homework will be Thursdays at 11:59pm.
