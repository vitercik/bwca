---

4/24
: **Lecture**{: .label .label-blue }
: - Random graphs. Planted models. A spectral algorithm for the planted bisection problem.
: - [Lecture notes](https://vitercik.github.io/bwca/assets/notes/l9.pdf)
: - [Textbook](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13773968): Chapter 8
: - The planted bisection model is from [Graph bisection algorithms with good average case behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02579448) (Bui/Chaudhuri/Leighton/Siper, 1987).
: - The matrix perturbation approach is from [Spectral Partitioning of Random Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/959929) (McSherry, 2001).
: - Our presentation is loosely based on lecture notes of Spielman, [here](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/lect21-15.pdf) and [here](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/2012/lect21-12.pdf).
